# Simple TypeScript-React Calculator

A simple calculator app with React-TypeScript build.

Originally coded in JavaScript-React, I migrated the code to TypeScript to see if there are compiling issues. In the end, I was able to migrate the project to TypeScript code without any issues.

See the live demo [here](https://synerjay.github.io/TypeScript-Calculator/).
